# Lancaster Productions
This is a website project dedicated to showcasing the learnings and abilities gained through the Monash Bootcamp Coding Course.

# Description
This is a portfolio of my work. The porfolio will be updated as my skills and knowledge in coding increases.
I have included some of my own photography for the graphics in this portfolio.
Additional pages are included and can be found in the drop-down menu. These pages will be updated as the porfolio grows and matures.

# Usage

# Support

# Roadmap
Future updates will be to complete the under construction pages, update the contact form with pdp to allow for emails to be sent to myself from the portfolio site and to tidy up any items that require it.
Additonal apps will be added to all lists as more pieces are learned and the site develops.
